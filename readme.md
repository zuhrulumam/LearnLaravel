# Learn Laravel 5.2 Project and Semantic-UI

This project created based on my experience of learning Laravel 5.2 and Semanric-UI (study case Blog).

One Day One Function .. :v

Day 1 : 
- Install Laravel 5.2
- integrate Laravel with Semantic-UI (http://semantic-ui.com/)
- Making Semantic-UI cheatsheet page

Day 2 :
- Learn Semantic-UI (i think it's harder than bootstrap)
- create homepage for user and dashboard (not yet finished -- i think i will have 3 days more to finish this )

Day 3 :
- setting up env for database connection (PostgreSQL)
- Creating blog table with migration
(for time being i will focus on my strength --> backend :v)
(not yet with CRUD, a lot of things to learn :v)
- create view for creating blog post (not yet finished) 

Day 4 :
- Create Read Update Delete Post (take 1 hour to finish this, well in yii2 it just take 3 minutes less :v)
(i think tomorrow will work the UI, i hope so .. )

Day 5 : 
Okayyyy.. today i realize that semantic-ui require more time to learn than bootstrap. Because i want finish my main object here quickly (learning laravel), so tomorrow i will change this project UI into bootstrap. :v
